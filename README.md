Guess What The Ultimate Single-Player Word Guessing Adventure

Phase 0: 
PART A:
Title of the Project: Guess What : The Ultimate Single-Player Word-Guessing Adventure
Project Description: “Guess What” is a single-player word-guessing game with a score or leaderboard system. The game uses an API to generate words based on the player's choice of themes. Each round has a limited number of guesses, and correct answers earn points. Bonus points may be earned for guessing within a time frame or using fewer guesses. The game's interface includes a hints section, and the leaderboard system allows players to compete online. The database stores game data. 

Phase 1: 
PART B: Project Description (revised):
Part C: Functional requirements:

Implement a word guess game with a user-friendly interface. Here are the features that we can include:
Word Lists: The game can include different word lists such as common words, difficult words, or words related to a specific theme, such as sports or food.
Difficulty Levels: The game can include a feature that allows the player to select the difficulty level, such as easy, medium, or hard. This feature can affect the number of chances they have to guess the word and the number of points awarded for a correct guess.
Bonus Points: The game can include a feature that allows the player to earn bonus points by guessing words within a certain time frame or by using fewer guesses than allowed.
Time-Based Mode: The game can include a time-based mode where the user has a limited time to guess the word.
Hint Button: The game can include a hint button that the player can use to receive a clue or reveal a letter about the word they are trying to guess.
Coins System: The game can allow users to earn coins or points by guessing words correctly and use them to purchase hints or unlock higher difficulty levels.
Leaderboard System: The game can include a leaderboard feature to track the top scorers of the game. This feature can also allow the player to submit their score and compete with other players online.
Game History: The game can store information on the player's game history, such as their highest score, average score, and number of games played.
Performance Optimization: Ensuring that our site loads quickly and efficiently by optimising images, code, and other assets.
Responsive Design: Ensuring that our site is optimised for different screen sizes and devices, including smartphones and tablets.
Animation Background: The game can include an animation in the background while playing the game.
Qwerty Keyboard: To make it easier for the player to input letters, we can include a Qwerty keyboard that they can use to select the letters. This feature can make the game more user-friendly, especially for players who may have difficulty typing on a traditional keyboard.
Word Matching: We can implement a way to check if the generated word matches the user's input. This can be done by comparing each letter of the generated word with the letters inputted by the user. We can include a feature that validates the user input to ensure that it only includes valid letters. This can prevent the player from entering numbers or special characters that are not part of the word.
Word Generator API: Instead of manually creating word lists, we can integrate an API that generates word lists for us. This feature can provide a more diverse selection of words for the player to guess, and can also save time and effort in manually creating and updating word lists.
